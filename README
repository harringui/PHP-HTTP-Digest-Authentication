Users and passwords are stored in the database.

The realm is hardcoded in class/login.class.php.
realm="Private Secure Network"

if you want to create a new user please:

insert into users set username='admin', password=md5("admin:Private Secure Network:adminpass"); 

hope you like it. This is my first github repo.

cheers, Ignacio.
